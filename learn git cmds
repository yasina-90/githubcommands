# Git Commands Guide

Git commands are fundamental for version control and collaboration in software development. Here's a comprehensive guide to some essential Git commands:

## Configuration and Initialization:

- `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`: Set your global username.
- `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`: Set your global email address.
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository from a remote URL to your local machine.

## Basic Workflow:

- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory and staged changes.
- `git add <file>`: Add a file to the staging area.
- `git add .` or `git add --all`: Add all changes to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git commit -am "Commit message"`: Add and commit all changes in one step.
- `git diff`: Show the difference between the working directory and the staging area.
- `git diff --staged` or `git diff --cached`: Show the difference between the staging area and the last commit.

## Branching and Merging:

- `git branch`: List all branches in the repository.
- `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switch to a different branch.
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>`: Create and switch to a new branch in one step.
- `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge changes from a specified branch into the current branch.
- `git branch -d <branch-name>`: Delete a branch (only if its changes are already merged).
- `git branch -D <branch-name>`: Force delete a branch, discarding changes (use with caution).

## Remote Repositories:

- `git remote add origin <repository-url>`: Link your local repository to a remote repository.
- `git push -u origin <branch-name>`: Push changes from your local branch to the remote repository.
- `git pull origin <branch-name>`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local branch.
- `git fetch`: Fetch changes from the remote repository without merging.
- `git remote -v`: List all remote repositories and their URLs.
- `git remote remove <remote-name>`: Remove a remote repository link from your local repository.

## Undoing Changes:

- `git reset HEAD <file>`: Unstage changes for a specific file from the staging area.
- `git checkout -- <file>`: Discard changes in a specific file and revert to the last commit's state.
- `git revert <commit-hash>`: Create a new commit that undoes changes made in a specific commit.
- `git reset --hard HEAD`: Reset the working directory and staging area to match the last commit (use with caution, as it's a destructive operation).

## Viewing History and Logs:

- `git log`: View commit history, including commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages.
- `git log --oneline`: Show a condensed version of the commit log, displaying only the commit hashes and messages.
- `git log --graph --oneline --all`: Visualize the commit history graph with branches and merges.
- `git show <commit-hash>`: Show detailed information about a specific commit.

These commands should give you a solid foundation for using Git effectively. Remember to explore Git's extensive documentation and resources for more advanced features and workflows. Practice with real projects will also help solidify your understanding.
